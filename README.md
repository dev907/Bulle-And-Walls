# GOAL:
In class 21 you learned how to extend the feature of collisions and created your own library which allows you to try collisions with more than one object.  In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learned in the class and test the reliability of the walls when bullets hit them.

# STORY:
The Military saw your Car collision project and they were interested in assigning you another project. They have given you $1000 to test the reliability of walls when bullets hit them.

They test the effectiveness of walls against bullets, amongst other things. All walls are made of concrete material. If the damage to the wall from the bullet exceeds a certain value, the material used to make the wall is rejected.
